# constrainedRL

This is a ongoing research project that extends the content from the [State Augmented Constrained Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11941.pdf) paper. It makes use of the architectures from the [Alelab graph neural network library](https://github.com/alelab-upenn/graph-neural-networks).
